# Day_01

Day 1 introduces Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and explains why managing infrastructure through code is better than manual setup. You learn how Terraform works, why it’s widely used, and what makes it powerful—such as consistency, automation, version control, and reduced human errors. The session also covers the Terraform workflow (init, validate, plan, apply, destroy) and provides steps to install Terraform on macOS and Linux.
