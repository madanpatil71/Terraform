Day 1 introduces Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and explains why managing infrastructure through code is better than manual setup. It helps to learn how Terraform works, why it’s widely used, and what makes it powerful—such as consistency, automation, version control, and reduced human errors. It also covers the Terraform workflow (init, validate, plan, apply, destroy) and provides steps to install Terraform on macOS and Linux.
